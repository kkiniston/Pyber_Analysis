# Pyber_Analysis
## Background
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Deliverable

- 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
- 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

## Summary

- The purpose of this analysis was to provide a visual display of the ride-sharing data across different sity types. From the chart you can seee that the total number of rides is signifigantly higher in the urban city types, comparitively to the suburban and rual locations. The results reflect concurently across the other catigoried in the analysis with the exeption for the fare/ride rate. As expected in areas where the access ro ride sharing options the fare rate would reflect in a more fiscally benificial way for the driver.

1. Further analysis can be conducted in the common drop-off//Pick up locations in rural areas; for example in a smaller college town- a higher percentage of those rides coming from the dorms to grocery store can pinpoint an area where fares can be filtered into to reduce the prices. 
2. Analysis into the income rates of those living in the various city types; have a job [yes/no]// annual income [$$$]// own a vehicle / have access to someone with a vehicle [yes/no]
3. Look at how consistantly ride share programs are used by those to find commonalities amungst those who use the service daily.
